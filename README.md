# Random OSX Console theme

This script allows you to change the theme of your terminal to a random one. I use this mainly for quickly differenciating a new terminal from the others.

Sometimes, when you have more than one terminal, you confuse which terminal is running what, the idea of this is to easily change to a random theme to easily differentiate a new console.

Script taken from [khansef's](https://gist.github.com/khansensf/1714326) gist.

## How to execute

Simply type rnd in your console.
